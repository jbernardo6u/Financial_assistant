"This is the virtual Assistant for financial advice "
#1. Introduction
##Project Context

Nowadays, investing in the stock market of company shares is largely reserved for an elite group of people trained in business management and investments, or for those who, out of curiosity, self-teach themselves to achieve modest success. Even for those who possess the necessary skills, the process of analyzing and investing in companies with long-term growth potential is time-consuming and complex. It requires analyzing various financial documents, such as balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements from the last 10 years of a company's operations. This process can be very lengthy and prone to errors, even for the most experienced professionals.

The objective of this project is to develop a virtual financial assistant that helps anyone invest in the stock market by proposing investment strategies based on detailed analysis of companies' financial documents, presented clearly through a dashboard.
